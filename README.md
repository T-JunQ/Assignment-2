# Game items Marketplace
Our project is based on a marketplace where you are able to buy,sell and overlook game items. The site would promote the service to users of the website, create or log into a account, view all of the item listings by diffrent users and the games associated with them, list items they have bought from the website, see the items they have bought and move their items from the website to the games (steam account).

## Design Process
The purpose of our website is to make buying and selling of video game items easier and simpler. It is also to advertise it's services to first time users of the site.
For the audience of our website, we are anticipating Buyers, Sellers and Potential users who is intrested in using the website.
