# Game items Marketplace

Our project is based on a fictional marketplace called GameHub where you are able to buy,sell and overlook game items. The site would promote the service to users of the website, create or log into a account, view all of the item listings by diffrent users and the games associated with them, list items they have bought from the website and see the items they have bought.
